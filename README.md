# DoctorCalc

## About

DoctorCalc is the final project I made for the CS50x course. It is a demo of a web app featuring medical calculators and
criteria tests/scores, designed primarily for doctors. In its
current form, it contains three calculators and three medical
scores, along with a login and registration system. Registration allows users to add items to their favorites.

The front end is created with:

-   HTML
-   SCSS
-   Bootstrap
-   Vanilla JavaScript

The back end is created with:

-   Python
-   Flask
-   SQLite
